  Blazing fast Gatsby eCommerce site for ±Ndesign florist
</h1>

This is a Gatsby eCommerce site with Stripe integration handling both payments and products/skus.

# ✅ **to do list**

* create a basket page where you can remove items and see subtotal

* create a design language for site

* remove template clutter

* set up a webhook to rebuild the site each time a new product/sku is added

* research an alternative to stripe that can handle all the unique types of Japanese payment - e.g. conbini, bank transfer, paypay, au, softbank

* research an alternative to stripe that has a friendlier GUI for creating products/skus

* decide on CSS style - *CSS-in-JS (this might require a further plugin) vs componentised CSS*
